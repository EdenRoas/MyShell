# MyShell

# What is this project?

This project is a shell program

# The way we made our project:
Basiclly this is an infinite loop reciving commands from the user. 

If the command is in our "command arsenal" we will execute it, if not we will send it to a regular bash and try to commit it.

# Command arsenal

*quit* - exits the shell.

*echo* - prints what ever comes after the ECHO.

*cd* - try to enter the reposetory after the CD command (MUST BE INSIDE THE CURRET REPOSETORY).

*prompt* - change the Shell name.

*!!* - does the last command commited.

*$?* - prints last command's status.

*$x = Eden* - variable decleration.

*read x | Eden* - variable decleration using scanning input from user.
